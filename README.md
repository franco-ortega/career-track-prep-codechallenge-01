## Objects

**Basics:**
Object literal shorthands create properties where the key and value are the same, but shorthands do not work when the key and value need to be different.

**Computed Properties:**
Brackets must be placed around computed properties.
#

## Classes
**Creation:** A class creates an object that can contain properties and functions.

**Statics:** Static properties and functions can only be called on the classes themselves, and they cannot be called on the objects created by these classes.

**Extends:**
Classes extended from a parent class are able to access properties and functions from the parent class.
#

## Destructuring

**Array Destructuring:**
This provides the ability to access items in an array by giving them variable names as opposed to accessing them by the indices of the array.

**String Destructuring:**
Each character of a string can also be accessed by providing a variable name for each character, and if there are more variables than characters, the excess variables are undefined.

**Object Destructuring:**
This provides the ability to access the property of an object by giving it a variable name

**Destructuring with Defaults:**
Defaults provide variables a set value to use if the variable is not provided by the array or object.

**Destructuring Function Parameters:**
The parameters passed into a function can be destructured in order to access the values of properties inside an object.

**Destructuring with Alias:**
Object property values can be assigned new variables with default values that override the original value.
#

## Rest
**Rest as a Parameter:**
A rest paramater can be used after all the listed paramaters to place any and all remaining parameters inside a new array.

**Rest while Destructuring:**
The rest parameter can be used to collect all the items from an array and place them in a new array, or it can be used to add items to the end of an existing array.
#

## Spread
**Array Spread:**
The spread parameter can be used to place items from one array into any location of another array, and it provides the ability to access items from an array as function parameters.
#

## Function Defaults
**Function Defaults:**
Default values can be given to function parameters, which can avoid errors when the parameter has not been defined.
